# PageBuilder - Cancelled
repo name is a placeholder lol

i was kinda bored so i made this lol

if you wanna use this put this:

`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/SanicBTW/PageBuilder/src/builder.js"></script>`

in the head of your html file

Sad to say that JSDelivr cache (for me I guess) is stuck in an old version and keeps happening the same thing over and over again so I have to change the source (@latest / @master / .min.js / ...) so I will release a stable release soon

In order to get IntelliSense you might have to download the file and put it into your projects folder (and have the file open in another tab of vs code)

# Why was it cancelled

Well it was a dumb project after all and I lost any motivation to continue with it so yeah, its dead lol
