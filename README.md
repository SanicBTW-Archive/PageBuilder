# PageBuilder
repo name is a placeholder lol

i was kinda bored so i made this lol

if you wanna use this put this:

`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/SanicBTW/PageBuilder/src/builder.js"></script>`

in the head of your html file

Sad to say that JSDelivr cache (for me I guess) is stuck in an old version and keeps happening the same thing over and over again so I have to change the source (@latest / @master / .min.js / ...) so I will release a stable release soon
